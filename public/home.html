			<a name="about"></a><h2 style="margin-top: 100px">About the club</h2>
			<p>Founded in the 2015&ndash;2016 school year, the McKinney Boyd High School Computer Science Club (MBHS CS Club)
			was formed by several individuals with a passion for programming when they took computer science classes at McKinney Boyd High School.
			This year, we have 40 members interested in our club. Membership in the club does not require a certain commitment
			to come to every meeting&mdash; we are flexible. We alternate our meetings every week between Tuesdays and Fridays &mdash;
			sign up for our Remind by texting @mbhscs to 81010 for meeting times.</p>
			<h3>What do we do?</h3>
			<p>We cover many programming-related events and general programming education. Some of the things you can do in our meetings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Compete in MBHS&#39;s Computer Science UIL team</li>
				<li>Further interest in theoretical and applied programming concepts</li>
				<li>Join the Technology Students Association (TSA) and compete in fun, specific competitions</li>
				<li>Learn some practical computer security skills with CTF competitions (capture the flag)</li>
				<li>Learn some Java or get tutoring (on Community Outreach Day)</li>
			</ul>
			<a name="cod"></a><h3 style="margin-top: 100px">Community Outreach Day</h3>
			<p>Computer Science Club officers have come to a conclusion that it would not be in our best interests to both pursue our own CS interests and to teach basic Java.</p>
			<p>Beginning February 3, 2016, regular Computer Science Club meetings will focus on exploring new subjects in CS ourselves but not basic Java tutorials. When we have a Community Outreach Day, which
			will be the last meeting we have every month, we will also be able to teach basic Java and assist with tutoring for APCS.</p>
			<p>Newcomers unfamiliar with Java are welcome to explore with us the subjects we will cover, but basic Java tutorials will not be done publicly at regular meetings.</p>
			<p>Should you have any questions about this new arrangement, please ask on Remind or Slack.</p>
			<h3>Officers</h3>
			<p>Officers preside over meetings and provide leadership in the direction of the club. If you have any questions for them,
			please ask them on <a href="#slack">Slack</a>. If you are not a member of the club, please direct your general inquiries
			to our <a href="#contact">contact info</a> below.</p>

			<!--<a name="codegolf"></a><h2 style="margin-top:100px">Twitter CodeGolf</h2>
				<p class="lead">Sponsored by MBHS Computer Science Club</p>
				<p><b>Due to lack of demand, we are no longer running Twitter CodeGolf.</b></p>
				<p>Each week, MBHS CS Club will release a Twitter CodeGolf problem. The problem must be
				solved in Java 8. The winner is declared a Twitter CodeGolf champion.
				Here&#39;s how our Twitter CodeGolf competitions work:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Imagine the class name has already been declared.</li>
					<li>All methods should be static, unless you need them nonstatic. In that case, imagine the class is called "C".</li>
					<li>If your code uses the main method, it is acceptable to replace <code>class MyClass { public static void main ( String[] args ) { content here } }</code> with <code>main{ content here }</code>.</li>
					<li>Imagine the main{} class can "return" something (yes, although this is technically invalid, it&#39;s our rule!). You do not need to specify the return data type in the method signature.</li>
					<li>Your code must be 132 characters or less. The other 8 characters in the tweet are used for "@mbhscs ", so that you may respond to our challenge.</li>
					<li>To submit a solution, your tweet MUST be a reply tweet to our challenge post tweet.</li>
					<li>You can delete and revise your solution as many times as you want before the deadline. The deadline may be stated on the tweet
					or it could be arbitrary.</li>
					<li>You may not use glitches in the Java compiler to gain points.</li>
					<li>Your code MUST compile successfully and run correctly to gain points.</li>
					<li>The shortest correct solution submitted in the alloted timeframe wins.</li>
					<li>If an input file is used, assume a Scanner object "s" is instantiated with the appropriate input file.
					Simply use "s" as if it was already instantiated.</li>
					<li>If you believe this problem is not possible in 132 characters (which on occasion we may throw one of these),
					throw an ArrayOutOfBoundsException (because why not).</li>
					<li>If there is a tie in character length, then the person who submitted the answer quicker wins.</li>
					<li>To clarify the problem, reply with CLARIF: and then continue asking your clarification.</li>
					<li>A contest staffer will respond with either "Correct - # characters" (and maybe with clarification of scoring) or "Incorrect - clarification".
					Their decision may be appealed by you via Twitter direct messaging (DM) (which has an essentially limitless character limit now, so it&#39;s a great place
					to justify your answer) but the appeals decision, which will be shared with you via DM, is final.</li>
					<li>No points are lost for an incorrect response.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Watch our Twitter feed for tweets pertaining to our CodeGolf competitions. Good luck!</p>

			<p><b>Due to lack of demand, we have closed the Geniuses Bar.</b></p>
			<div class="jumbotron">
			<p>Having a problem with your MacBook and don&#39;t want to wipe your computer completely? Having some questions
			on using programs? Want to install programs onto your computer? Want us to fix your computer instead of
			the MacBook help desk?</p>

			</div>
			<p>McKinney Boyd Computer Science Club is excited to offer a Geniuses Bar to all students with computers at McKinney
			Boyd HS. (This not only includes those with MacBooks from McKinney ISD&#39;s "One to the World" Program but also personally-owned laptops!)
			Not only do we emphasize preserving your data (unlike the MacBook help desk), but we also show you how to
			use programs and do what is normally done to take care of computers. Our geniuses are experts in computers
			and are overqualified to help you.</p>
			<p>Drop by during a CS Club meeting! We are open every 1st full week and 3rd full week Friday, and every 2nd full week
			and 4th full week Tuesday. You aren&#39;t required to be a member of the CS Club, but we do prioritize help requests from our
			CS Club members. Currently, our Geniuses offer their services kindly for free. In the future, we may
			begin charging very reasonable fees ($1-$5) to support the MBHS Computer Science Club&#39;s activities financially.</p>
			<p>You are more than welcome to come unannounced to our CS Club meetings. However, we recommend you
			fill out a help request form so we can contact you and give you the exact date of the next meeting, and,
			if needed, to research your issue to quickly and accurately assist you on the meeting day.</p>
