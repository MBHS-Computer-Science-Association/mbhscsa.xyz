			<a name="about"></a><h2 style="margin-top: 100px">About the club</h2>
			<p>Are you interested, passionate in coding, programming, or making things on computers in general? Want to expand your horizons and
			get ready for computer science classes in high school?</p>
			<p>The McKinney Boyd High School Computer Science Club is currently looking to expand our outreach to middle and elementary schoolers. Our
			current priority is working with students in schools that feed into Boyd. We'll bring our practical insight into CS from high school to
			passionate future coders.</p>
			<p>Our first focus is establishing a Computer Science Club at Dowell Middle School, one of four middle schools feeding into Boyd.
			Of incoming students from middle schools, a plurality of students are from DMS.</p>
			<p>So congratulations, lucky Lions! We're coming to your school! Please share this link to everybody you know, especially those interested
			in programming or coding.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Coming into existence in the 2016&ndash;2017 school year, the Dowell Middle School Computer Science Club
			will be sponsored by the Club Outreach initiative of McKinney Boyd High School Computer Science Club.
			Membership in the club will be free but requires attendance after school at our meeting times. Exact dates will
			be decided as next school year approaches.</p>
			<h3>What do we do?</h3>
			<p>We will learn how to code and discuss the cool stuff we learn. Some of the things you can do in our meetings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Learn coding</li>
				<li>Discuss interesting things you've made</li>
				<li>Think about computer science concepts</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Officers, Mentors</h3>
			<p>Our club will not have officers the first day; an election will later be held when deemed appropriate.
			However, the DMS CS Club will be sponsored by the MBHS CS Club. Below are the DMS CS Club's mentors from MBHS CS Club:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Trevor "Thai" Nguyen &mdash; President of MBHS CS Club, Mentor</li>
				<li>Jeffrey Wang &mdash; former Vice President of MBHS CS Club, Head of Club Outreach, Mentor &mdash; will be assisting remotely from the University of North Texas whenever possible</li>
				<li>Sammy Shin &mdash; Mentor</li>
				<li>Bora Gomez &mdash; Mentor</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>To teachers: Please sponsor us!</h3>
			<p>We would be <b>extremely grateful</b> if you would be willing to sponsor the club. As computer science is becoming more important, the subject
			is quickly becoming a core one. We feel that STEM-related teachers would be most helpful in our club, but regardless of your teaching subject,
			we would be super excited to work with you to bring programming to Dowell students. Please email
			<a href="mailto:trevor.nguyen500@student.mckinneyisd.net">trevor.nguyen500@student.mckinneyisd.net</a> if you are interested. Thank you!!</p>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 100px">Affiliated clubs and organizations</h3>
			<p>We share a common goal with slightly differently oriented clubs and organizations. Below are our affiliations, with which we currently encourage our members to participate.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>McKinney Boyd High School Computer Science Club</li>
				<li>Dowell MS Robotics Club (beginning 2016&ndash;2017)</li>
			</ul>
